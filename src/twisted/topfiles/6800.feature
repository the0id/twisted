twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now has the new constructor argument 'raiseMinimumTo', allowing you to increase the minimum TLS version to this version or Twisted's default, whichever is higher. The additional new constructor arguments 'lowerMaximumSecurityTo' and 'insecurelyLowerMinimumTo' allow finer grained control over negotiated versions that don't honour Twisted's defaults, for working around broken peers, at the cost of reducing the security of the TLS it will negotiate.
