<kenaan> Amber Brown closed <https://tm.tl/#8214> - Twisted should move to a src/ directory layout

<runciter> the problem with scrum and agile is that, ironically, it doesn't seem to work well when you don't know what you don't know
<runciter> what happens if your story is "make our data storage consistent, available and partition-resistant"
<runciter> and you only get ACM access halfway through the sprint
%
<runciter> it's a consultancy about nothing
<meejah> we could call it Scrumfeld

<lukasa> Could I solve the problem of evil?
<lukasa> I mean, look, my suspicion is that the solution to the problem of evil is probably not implementable within the twisted codebase.
<lukasa> I'm not even entirely certain that it can be done in userspace.

<vshyba> Twisted is awesome, I feel like Neo in Matrix when he pauses bullets: self.transport.pauseProducing()

<runciter> glyph: i feel like not checking certs was the most popular thing in the world in 2008
<runciter> it was like, 1) not checking cert validity 2) ruby on rails

<runciter> it appears that i've been banned from most servers
<@glyph> runciter: you probably joined too many channels from the same nick / IP
<runciter> glyph: yep :(  since this currently in the "dumb hack" stage of development i figured my code would blow up first
<@glyph> runciter: that is a common problem with first-run Twisted services
<@glyph> runciter: it's more likely you'll knock over the service you're talking to than that you'll crash
<runciter> glyph: why does it have to work so well
<runciter> glyph: this was never a problem with gevent

<derwolfe> Twisted - thank you for continuing to be fun to use and relatively easy to test ðŸ˜ƒ
